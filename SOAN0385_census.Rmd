In this lesson, we will cover how to find and download US Census data from [Social Explorer](http://go.middlebury.edu/socialexplorer), and how to load and start working with this data in R. 

When you go to Social Explorer, you should see the following image in the upper-right of the page:

If you use the go/ link, [go/socialexplorer/](http://go.middlebury.edu/socialexplorer), you'll always get to the license provided by Middlebury.

Here are the basic steps to getting data from Social Explorer:

1. Click in the upper-corner to "Sign up"
2. Create an account using your Midd email
3. Click on "My Projects" and then "Create" a report (not a map)
4. Click on the source you want data from (**in our case, use ACS 2016 (5-year estimates)**)
5. Choose your geography (**in our case, choose "County," then "all counties"**)
6. Choose the tables you want (**in our case, choose "T37: Unemployment Rate for Civilian Population in Labor Force 16 Years and Over", "T53: Employment Sector for Employed Civilian Population 16 Years and Over", and "T130: Residence 1 Year Ago in the United States"**)
7. Check what you got by clicking **"Show Results"**
8. If it looks right, go to **"Data Download"** on the top
9. Leave all the boxes unchecked and download the **CSV and and the "Data dictionary (text file)"** - note where you downloaded them too.

Once you've downloaded the data and codebook, you'll need to move them into your project directory. The following code will work for those of you with access to the bash shell, but you'll need to change the filename to match. Look at the beginning of your codebook (the .txt file) and put that where the code below says "REPLACE" - for example, my file is "R11617995.txt" so I would have `file_string=R11617995` in my code below. The code also assumes that you've placed the project directory on your desktop.

```{bash}
file_string=R11617995 # REPLACE here

mv ~/Downloads/$file_string* ~/Desktop/SOAN0385_census
```

Now we can load the data into R. We'll be using `read_csv()`, which is just a faster version of `read.csv()` and is included in the tidyverse package. You'll need to replace the file_string like you did above in the code below.


```{r}
file_string = "R11617995" # REPLACE here as needed
acs <- read_csv(paste(file_string, "_SL050.csv", sep = ""))

glimpse(acs)
```

As you can see from looking at the variables, we've got a number of variables who are **all** NAs. These are unused columns for different types of geographies. It would be great to get rid of these. The following code will do that, by turning each value into a logical value (based on the `is.na()` result), then going column by column (this is the `2` value in `apply()`) and seeing which columns are ALL NAs, and then only keeping the columns which are NOT all NAs.

```{r}
acs_trim <- acs[, !apply(is.na(acs), 2, all)]

glimpse(acs_trim)
```

Ah! Much better - but we still have a lot of variables with hard-to-decipher names. This is why we made sure to download the codebook! Let's open it and have a look. 

```{r}
file.edit(paste(file_string, ".txt", sep = ""))
```

We can create a vector of more usable column names and apply those to our dataset - this part takes a little time, but makes your dataset **much** easier to work with, and your code easier to understand.

```{r}
columns <- c("fips",
             "geo_id",
             "geo_name",
             "geoqual_name",
             "state",
             "summary_level",
             "geo_component",
             "file_id",
             "logical_record",
             "state_fips",
             "county_fips",
             "labor_force",
             "labor_force_employed",
             "labor_force_unemployed",
             "employed",
             "employed_private_sector",
             "employed_public_sector",
             "employed_self_employed",
             "employed_private_non_profit",
             "employed_unpaid_family_workers",
             "population_over_one_year_old",
             "same_house_one_year_ago",
             "moved_within_county",
             "moved_diff_county_within_state",
             "moved_diff_state",
             "moved_from_abroad")

colnames(acs_trim) <- columns

glimpse(acs_trim)
```

Ah! Something we can work with!


Now we can do a quick plot of our data we're interested in! Our independent variable is how many workers were in the private sector, and our dependent is the unemployment rate. Let's take a look at that.

```{r}
ggplot(acs_trim, aes(employed_private_sector/employed, labor_force_unemployed/labor_force)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Hm. There doesn't seem to be much of a relationship. It would be great if we could make one visual comparing the relationships between all the sectors and the unemployment rate, but that would be difficult to do with the data in the state it's currently in. We need to clean the data up a bit more using the `gather()` and `mutate()` functions to make it even easier to work with. We'll clean up all the data while we're at.

```{r}
acs_tidy <- acs_trim %>%
  gather(moved_or_not, population, c("same_house_one_year_ago", "moved_within_county", "moved_diff_county_within_state", "moved_diff_state", "moved_from_abroad")) %>%
  mutate(prop_of_moved = population/population_over_one_year_old) %>%
  gather(sector, workers, c("employed_private_sector", "employed_public_sector", "employed_self_employed", "employed_private_non_profit", "employed_unpaid_family_workers")) %>%
  mutate(prop_workers = workers/employed) %>%
  mutate(unemployment_rate = labor_force_unemployed/labor_force)

glimpse(acs_tidy)
```

Now we can make one graph, with all the different sectors and the unemployment rate. 

```{r}
acs_tidy %>% ggplot(aes(prop_workers, unemployment_rate, color = sector)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Wow. That's really unpleasant to try and read. We can use the `facet_grid()` function of ggplot2 to make this a bit easier. 

```{r}
acs_tidy %>% ggplot(aes(prop_workers, unemployment_rate)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + facet_grid(sector ~ .)
```

There we are! What are your thoughts?
